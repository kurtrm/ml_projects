I can't find a very intuitive explanation on the internet, but from trying to put two and two together, I think it will  make its similarity decision based on how far it is from the landmark, if the Guassian radial basis function is centered on it. So if it's within _n_ standard deviations or something, it will classify it as _some class_.\n",
